Hi!
When I came to Germany to do my Erasmus I was expecting anything but this kind of course as I am a philosophy student in Milan, but since I was offered this option and you know, you go on Erasmus to do new things, I jumped in to learn something new and I must say I really enjoyed it!

Since I didn't have any previous knowledge in Python for my project, I preferred to use the various codes we learnt in class together and create something that would work, instead of risking doing something too complicated that wouldn't work in the end or that would create too many problems. I have to say that it was still quite a challenge, but that I am satisfied with the end result.

At the beginning I was full of ideas of possible things to create, videos, music, huge drawings with turtle, but unfortunately I had to scale back my expectations to my practical skills and decided that my final project would be a video with music created from an inherent input with musicgen.

1. It all started with the fact that instead of returning to live in Italy, I decided to move to Hamburg for the next few years and therefore had to look for a new flat to stay in. In my new flat, besides my roommate, there is also a cute black kitten living there who has a mood that fluctuates a bit and I don't know if he loves me or hates me completely... (**turtle/image/IMG_9601.jpg**)
2. From this photo I then created some pixelart with turtle (turtle/cat.py) which I saved in .eps format (**turtle/image/pixel_art.eps**) and then turned it into a video through an external software (**https://www.online-convert.com/result#j=906c4462-5239-4c4f-b984-b85301ad7591**) as I couldn't find a code that worked to save it directly. 
3. Once I had my video (**musicvideo/video/cat.mov**), I then created a short song with Musicgen (**musicvideo/music/textmusicupdated.py**) using ‘_i have a new black cat in my new house in hamburg! cosa pensi di me caro micio_’ as a prompt (english translation: '_i have a new black cat in my new house in hamburg! what do you think about me dear kitty_). In this way I felt I could both read my new cat's thoughts and turn his thoughts into music (**musicvideo/music/cat2.wav**)
4. At the end of everything I combined the pixel art video obtained with turtle and the track obtained with Musicgen through the file musicvideo/finallyyy.py and obtained the final project **musicvideo/video/example_w_sound20240826222912.mp4**

In order to present my project, I eventually decided to create a qr code (**qrcode/sum-up-qrcode.py**) through python (**qrcode/image/qrcode.png**) that links to my repository on python^_^
